# Github-API-Integration-and-Visualisation

## Part 1): Github Access
Interrogate the GitHub API to retrieve and display data regarding the logged in developer.
This is located in the Github Access folder.  The github API was interrogated using Java.  For this to run it required the dependecies of the GitHub Java API, Available at: https://github.com/eclipse/egit-github/tree/master/org.eclipse.egit.github.core and com.google.gson.gson https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson/2.3.1.
Both Jar files must be added to path build for a successful run.

 ## Part 2): Github Graph
Interrogate the GitHub API to build visualisation of data available.
I decided not to use the csv generated from Part 1 above. Instead JavaScript and CSS were used to create a Webapp that can be tested locally.  This is located in the Github Graph folder of this repo.
